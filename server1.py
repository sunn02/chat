## The server's main job is to receive messages, and then disperse 
## them to the connected clients. 
## For receiving messages, we're going to make a function:

    try: # ---> To test a block of code for errors

        message_header = client_socket.recv(HEADER_LENGHT)

        # If a client closes a connection gracefully, then a socket.close() will be issued and there will be no header.
        if not len(message_header):
            return False
        
        message_lengh = int(message_header.decode("utf-8")).strip(()) # ---> Header to lenght
        
        # Return an object of message header and message data
        return {'header': message_header, 'data': client_socket.recv(message_lengh) }
    
    except: # --> lets you to handle the error 

        # Something went wrong like empty message or client exited abruptly.
        return False

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# then send all of the messages out to all of the client sockets. 
# We need a loop

    #   This is a straightforward interface to the Unix select() system call. 
    #   The first three arguments are iterables of â€˜waitable objects
    #   - rlist - sockets to be monitored for incoming data, 'wait' until ready for reading
    #   - wlist - sockets for data to be send to, 'wait' until ready for writing
    #     (checks if for example buffers are not full and socket is ready to send some data)
    #   - xlist - sockets to be monitored for exceptions (we want to monitor all sockets for errors, so we can use rlist)
    # Returns lists:
    #   - reading - sockets we received some data on (that way we don't have to check sockets manually)
    #   - writing - sockets ready for data to be send thru them
    #   - errors  - sockets with some exceptions
